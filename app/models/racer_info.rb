  #use metaprogramming and dynamically create getter/setter for each property needed
  #define method declares a block that defines a particular method and the method can optionally take parameters
  #object.send("m",123) invokes method m on the object and can optionally pass parameters to that method
  #notes - just as name and name=(param) are getter and setters for name â€“ object.send("name") and
  #object.send("name=", value) are also getter and setter methods that can dynamically access object
  #methods without knowing the type ahead of time.

  #the following creates setters and getters for each address property within this class, making sure to apply the
  #single field change to an entire instance of Account that was created from the current state and reassigned as whole object
  ["city", "state"].each do |action| #city/state is an array passed in as the action to perform
    
    define_method("#{action}") do #acts as getter
